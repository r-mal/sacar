This is a preliminary repository created with the purpose of releasing the model architecture.
Right now, the data needs to be in an arcane format that was never designed for release - we will update the repo with a proper readme with running instructions once we can provide a reusable data preprocessing pipeline.

## Instalation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install the [tensorflow models official](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official) repo using the instructions they provide.
